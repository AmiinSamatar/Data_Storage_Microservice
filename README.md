Communication Contract for Requesting and Receiving Data from the Microservice:

#Timely Communication:
We will initiate dialog as early as possible to discuss the requirements of the microservice and any potential challenges.
Efficient and straight-to-the-point discussions will be encouraged to make decisions effectively.

#Detailed Discussions:
We will have more detailed discussions about the microservice implementation, including its functionalities and endpoints.
This will help ensure a clear understanding of each other's tasks and avoid any confusion or misunderstandings.

#Sharing Workload:
We will openly discuss any concerns about the complexity of the microservice and find ways to support each other.
If needed, we can distribute the workload more effectively based on individual expertise and availability.

#Requesting Data from the Microservice:
The requester will programmatically send a request to the microservice using Python's requests library.
The request will be made to the appropriate endpoint of the microservice, such as /add_vehicle or /get_vehicles.
Necessary data and parameters, such as vehicle details for adding or retrieving, will be included in the request.

#Receiving Data from the Microservice:
The requester will handle the response received from the microservice programmatically.
After sending a request, the requester will use Python's requests library to receive the response from the microservice.
If successful, the response will contain the requested data, which can be extracted and used by the requester.
